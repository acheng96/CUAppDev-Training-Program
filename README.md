# CUAppDev Training Program - Fall 2014

## Description

In Fall 2014, I participated in the inaugural Developer in Training program hosted by Cornell's CUAppDev Project Team, where I first gained exposure to mobile app development. The 10-week program consisted of a weekly lecture series focused on teaching iOS mobile app development using Swift and Xcode. This repository contains several of the projects I developed over the course of this program:
